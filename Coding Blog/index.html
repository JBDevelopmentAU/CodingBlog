            <p>My coding journey began at the end of 2021, where I started to dive in to HTML-5 and CSS-3. The blog
                posts will begin as of the 1st of January, 2022. Up until this point, I have completed an Introduction
                to HTML-5, Intermediate HTML-5, Introduction to CSS-3 and Intermediate CSS-3. I have also touched base
                on Version Control using GIt, and started to become fimilar with Terminal usage using GIT Bash.</p>

            <p>The first day of 2022, where my Full Time coding journey begins. I finished off the Intermediate CSS
                learnings, and prepared myself to start my Bootstrap 5 journey.</p>

            <p>Today, I created this Blog website to capture each step of my coding journey using what I have learnt
                thus far. I have also started to learn BootStrap 5, moving on to the next stage of building my coding
                knowledge database. I have learnt about Bootstrap, installed it, learnt about Grid Layout Systems and
                discovered Wireframing.</p>

            <p>I have continued to work with the Bootstrap fraomework today, covering Grid Layouts, CSS Link Orders,
                BootStrap Containers, Bootstrap Buttons using Font Awesome and general Bootstrap styling. Through
                completing this, I also began the Intermediate Bootstrap module - including learning about Bootstrap
                Carousel, Bootstrap Cards and the CSS Z-Index and Stacking Order.</p>

            <p>Day fout, and I am getting more and more in to the habit of coding with ease. My progression thus far has
                been decent, and I am happy with what I have achieved over the past few days. Today I learnt about CSS Media Query Breakpoints, </p>
